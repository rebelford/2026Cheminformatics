    "In this course, we will use a Linux command-line environment to install, configure, and manage the software needed for our Python-based data science work. Rather than relying on graphical tools, we will use basic Linux (bash) commands to interact directly with the operating system that hosts our Python environments. On Windows systems, this means installing and working inside the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), which provides a lightweight Linux environment on your computer. This appendix focuses on installing WSL and learning the essential Linux commands we will use throughout the course; the next appendix covers installing Miniconda and creating Python environments within that system.\n",

    "> *Note (Mac users):*\n",
    "> You do **not** need to install WSL if you are using macOS. macOS already provides a Unix-based terminal that can run the Linux command-line tools used in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Before installing WSL, ensure your computer meets these requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 50-100 GB of free space on your hard drive\n",
    "- At least 8 GB RAM for basic usage and exercises in this class\n",
    "- 16 GB RAM or more recommended for intensive machine learning activities\n",
    "- Windows 10 version 2004 or higher, or Windows 11\n",
    "- Administrative privileges on your computer\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, WSL installs the Ubuntu distribution of Linux, which is what we will use in this course. While WSL can run on traditional hard drives (HDDs), an SSD is strongly recommended for better performance.\n",
    "## 1.1 WSL Installation Instructions:\n",
    "1. Type: `\"Windows PowerShell\"` in the Windows search bar\n",

    "\n",
    "Although Conda can be installed directly on Windows, we will use WSL for several reasons:\n",

    "1. Many Python scientific libraries are better supported on Linux than on Windows  \n",
    "2. Linux is the standard environment for open-source scientific software  \n",
    "3. WSL integrates Linux with the Windows file system without requiring dual-booting  \n",
    "4. Python scripts often run faster under WSL than in a native Windows setup  \n",
    "5. Using a Linux environment ensures that the command-line instructions in this course are consistent across Windows (via WSL), macOS, and Linux systems  \n",
    "6. Learning basic Linux and bash commands is a valuable and transferable skill\n",
