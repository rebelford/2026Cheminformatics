# Cheminformatics 2026 — Jupyter Book & Course Materials

This repository contains the **source materials** for the *Cheminformatics 2026* course, including:

- Jupyter notebooks used for instruction
- A Jupyter Book built from those notebooks
- Supporting infrastructure for local execution and cloud deployment (e.g., nanoHUB)

The repository is designed to support **three use cases**:

1. Reading the course as a **published Jupyter Book**
2. Cloning the repository to **run notebooks locally**
3. Serving as the **source of truth** for downstream deployments (e.g., nanoHUB)
